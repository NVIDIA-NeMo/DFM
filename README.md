# NeMo DFM: Diffusion Foundation Models collection

NeMo DFM is a state-of-the-art framework for fast, large-scale training and inference of video world models. It unifies the latest diffusion-based and autoregressive techniques, prioritizing efficiency and performance from research prototyping to production deployment.

## Projects

This collection consists of 4 projects:
1. [Scalable diffusion training framework](nemo_vfm/diffusion/readme.rst)
2. [Accelerated diffusion world models](nemo_vfm/physicalai/Cosmos/cosmos1/models/diffusion/README.md)
3. [Accelerated autoregressive world models](nemo_vfm/physicalai/Cosmos/cosmos1/models/autoregressive/README.md)
4. [Sparse attention for efficient diffusion inference](nemo_vfm/sparse_attention/README.md)
